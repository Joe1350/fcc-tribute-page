        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex Grey was born on November 29, 1953 in Columbus, Ohio. He is an American visual artist, author, and teacher. He is known for creating spiritual and psychedelic paintings. He is married to Allyson Grey.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His father was a graphic designer and an artist. Grey was the middle child. He attended the Columbus College of Art and Design for two years before dropping out. Grey went on to study art the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts in Boston in 1975. Grey met his wife Allyson at a party at the end of art school.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey learned anatomy by working to prepare cadavers for dissection at Harvard Medical School's anatomy department. He worked there for five years. He also worked as a medical illustrator for approximately ten years in order to support his studio art practice. Grey also taught anatomy and figure sculpture at New York University for ten years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey's paintings are a blend of sacred, visionary art and postmodern art. He is best known for his paintings of glowing anatomical human bodies, images that “x-ray” the multiple layers of reality. His art is a complex integration of body, mind, and spirit. The Sacred Mirrors, a life-sized series of 21 paintings, took 10 years to complete, and examines in detail the physical and metaphysical anatomy of the individual. The inner body is meticulously rendered - not just anatomically precise but crystalline in its clarity. Many of his paintings include detailed representations of the skeleton, nervous system, cardiovascular system, and lymphatic system. Grey applies this multidimensional perspective to paint the universal human experience. His figures are shown in positions such as praying, meditating, kissing, copulating, pregnancy, birth, and death.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey's work incorporates many religious symbols, including auras, chakras, and icons with geometric shapes and tessellations in natural, industrial, and multicultural situations. His highly detailed paintings are spiritual and scientific in equal measure, revealing his psychedelic, spiritual and super-natural view of the human species. In 2002, Holland Cotter, New York Times art critic wrote, "Alex Grey's art, with its New Age symbolism and medical-illustration finesse, might be described as psychedelic realism, a kind of clinical approach to cosmic consciousness. In it, the human figure is rendered transparently with X-ray or CAT-scan eyes, the way Aldous Huxley saw a leaf when he was on mescaline. Every bone, organ and vein is detailed in refulgent color; objects and space are knitted together in dense, decorative linear webs."
